# Code Challenges
**The goal of this repository is to help facilitate learning from each other, and have fun while doing it.**

## Overview
One of the most useful avenues for me learning programming was having small, bite sized
challenges to try and solve. After programming every kind of cypher I knew how to do by hand,
I ran out ideas and my motivation (and learning) quickly came to a screeching halt. Then,
as I would find a new and exciting challenge, I would pick things back up and try and solve
it. But this was always limited to challenges I could come up with on my own. And these always
seemed to be few and far between. So the goal of this repo is to keep a steady stream of new,
small, bite sized challenges for people to participate in, and hopefully learn a thing or two
in the process. Or, at the very least, have some fun.

## Organization
Every other week, a new challenge will be posted in this repo. It will contain a README
file that briefly describes what the challenge is. It will also contain the "seed code" for
the challenge (i.e. an empty function where you will write your code and a few basic tests
to verify your code is doing what it is supposed to). It will also contain an `answers.json`
file with a whole slew of tests you can put your code through once it passes the initial tests.
These tests will be included in the seed file, but there will also be a description of how the
data is stored in `answers.json` so if there isn't a seed for the language you want to solve the
challenge in, you can write your own. Please feel free to make a PR with your seed code added to
the ReadMe so other people can benefit from it!

## Participation
To participate, first, fork the repo. Then, using the seed code of the desired language, create
a code file w/ your name (or github username) i.e. `jimmykodes.py` in the challenge's submissions
directory. Write your code there and then create a PR here from your fork. Please be conscientious
of any conflicts when making your PRs so I don't have to do a lot of extra work to merge your code.
Please try and refrain from looking into other people's submissions until you have actually completed
it yourself. No cheating ;)

#### Note:
There are issues created where you can comment and leave ideas for future challenges. This is still
limited to my imagination after all, so I'm all for crowd sourcing some challenge ideas as we go.
